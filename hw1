a. Jack Reeves views programming as a design activity. He thinks that there are certain parallels that can be drawn between 
software engineering and other engineering disciplines. However, he also sees that the process of designing software is very
different than the processes that other engineers use. For example, an engineer designing a bridge will do structural analysis,
build computer models and run scale tests before building the bridge. Software engineers continually build, test and debug 
their code. 

b. Many people in the software community don't agree with what Reeves said or don't understand what he was trying to say. 
Furthermore, it takes an above average, extremely skilled programmer to be able to design and code at the same time. As 
Reeves stated, "people think that if we force people to follow a detailed process, that eventually they will figure out what
they are doing and code it correctly." In reality, using tools and following a process does not make up for knowledge and 
experience.

c. On page 2, Reeves states that object oriented programming languages such as C++ have become popular due to a combination
of factors. He then states that C++ has become popular because it makes it easier to design software and program at the same
time. 

d. Software engineers don't adhere as strictly to the same design, refining, and testing as other engineers because the
process is different. Reeves says that developing software is actually "designing" software, and that building software 
is preformed by compilers. The software builds are cheap, but the design is expensive. In many engineering disciplines,
it would be extremely expensive to build prototypes, test and find issues with the design. Thus, calculations are preformed,
models are created, and scale tests are run. In software engineering, the developer can constantly edit, build and debug the
program.
